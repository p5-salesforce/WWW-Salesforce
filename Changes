0.303     2017-10-07
    - Fix dependency issue due to subclass with 'base'.
      Both SOAP::Lite and SOAP define SOAP::Serializer and SOAP seems to win the
      battle over SOAP::Lite in this scenario which isn't what we want or
      expect. (Thanks, Mohammad S Anwar!)

    - Fix licensing and authors to ensure everyone's credited properly.
    - Add LWP::Protocol::https to the prerequisites.

    - Note deprecation of get_clientM() in 0.400. it's a private method
    - Note deprecation of get_session_header() in 0.400. it's a private method
    - Note deprecation of get_session_headerM() in 0.400. it's a private method

    - Added the license file to the dist
    - Got rid of the 'use vars' pragma
    - Moved to Dist::Zilla for maintenance
    - Fixed license discrepancies. We've always stated that it's under the same
      license as Perl itself, but accidentally introduced Artistic 2.0 in the
      META. That has been put back to the Perl_5 license.
